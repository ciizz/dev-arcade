Development practices: 

Whenever you start work on a given task, create a branch with the issue Number of the task and branch of snapshot. 

A development task always implies a unit testing task for the given functionality/component under development. 

Github management practices: 

Never open a PR from a Issue branch to main. 
Issue branches can open PRs with snapshot only 
Never merge a PR that has not been approved by the reviewer
Snapshot will be merged into master periodically
